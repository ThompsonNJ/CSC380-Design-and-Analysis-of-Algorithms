The average length for finding the kth element is O(n). As you can see from my spreadsheet,
the first time QuickSelect calls the LomutoPartition algorithm, the number of comparisons is
equal to n - 1. However, on a list of length 1,000,000, a total number of 2,491,214 comparisons
were made. This is means the algorthm lies somewhere between O(n) and O(nlog(n)) (abeit it is
significantly closer to O(n).
